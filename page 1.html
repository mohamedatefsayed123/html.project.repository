        <u><h2>How is AI Used?</h2></u>
        <h3>Artificial intelligence generally falls under two broad categories: </h3>
        <h3><ul>
            <li>Narrow AI: </li>
        </ul></h3>
        <h4>Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," this kind of artificial intelligence operates within a limited context and is a simulation of human intelligence. Narrow AI is often focused on performing a single task extremely well and while these machines may seem intelligent, they are operating under far more constraints and limitations than even the most basic human intelligence.</h4>

        <h3><ul>
            <li>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):</li>
        </ul></h3>
        <h4>AGI, sometimes referred to as "Strong AI," is the kind of artificial intelligence we see in the movies, like the robots from Westworld or Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. AGI is a machine with general intelligence and, much like a human being, it can apply that intelligence to solve any problem. </h4>
        <u><h2>Artificial Intelligence Examples</h2></u>
        <h3><ul><li>Smart assistants (like Siri and Alexa)</li><li>Disease mapping and prediction tools</li><li>Manufacturing and drone robots</li><li>Optimized, personalized healthcare treatment recommendations</li><li>Conversational bots for marketing and customer service</li><li>Robo-advisors for stock trading</li><li>Spam filters on email</li><li>Social media monitoring tools for dangerous content or false news</li><li>Song or TV show recommendations from Spotify and Netflix</li></ul></h3>
