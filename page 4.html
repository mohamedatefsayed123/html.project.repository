    <h3>1966</h3>
    <h4>The Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) report by the U.S. government details the lack of progress in machine translations research, a major Cold War initiative with the promise of automatic and instantaneous translation of Russian. The ALPAC report leads to the cancellation of all government-funded MT projects.</h4>
    <h3>1974-1980</h3>
    <h4>Frustration with the progress of AI development leads to major DARPA cutbacks in academic grants. Combined with the earlier ALPAC report and the previous year's "Lighthill Report," artificial intelligence funding dries up and research stalls. This period is known as the "First AI Winter." </h4> 
    <h3>1987-1993</h3>
    <h4>As computing technology improved, cheaper alternatives emerged and the Lisp machine market collapsed in 1987, ushering in the "Second AI Winter." During this period, expert systems proved too expensive to maintain and update, eventually falling out of favor.
        Japan terminates the FGCS project in 1992, citing failure in meeting the ambitious goals outlined a decade earlier.
        DARPA ends the Strategic Computing Initiative in 1993 after spending nearly $1 billion and falling far short of expectations.</h4>
    <h3>2005</h3>
    <h4>    STANLEY, a self-driving car, wins the DARPA Grand Challenge.
        The U.S. military begins investing in autonomous robots like Boston Dynamic's "Big Dog" and iRobot's "PackBot."</h4>
    <h3>2012</h3>
    <h4>Andrew Ng, founder of the Google Brain Deep Learning project, feeds a neural network using deep learning algorithms 10 million YouTube videos as a training set. The neural network learned to recognize a cat without being told what a cat is, ushering in breakthrough era for neural networks and deep learning funding.</h4>
    <h3>2014</h3>
    <h4>Google makes first self-driving car to pass a state driving test.</h4>
    <h3>2016</h3>
    <h4>Google DeepMind's AlphaGo defeats world champion Go player Lee Sedol. The complexity of the ancient Chinese game was seen as a major hurdle to clear in AI.</h4>
