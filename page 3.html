        <u><h2>History of AI</h2></u>
        <h3>intelligent robots and artificial beings first appeared in the ancient Greek myths of Antiquity. Aristotle's development of the syllogism and it's use of deductive reasoning was a key moment in mankind's quest to understand its own intelligence. While the roots are long and deep, the history of artificial intelligence as we think of it today spans less than a century. The following is a quick look at some of the most important events in AI. </h3>
        <h3>1943</h3>
        <h4>Warren McCullough and Walter Pitts publish "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity." The paper proposed the first mathematic model for building a neural network.</h4>
        <h3>1949</h3>
        <h4>    In his book The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory, Donald Hebb proposes the theory that neural pathways are created from experiences and that connections between neurons become stronger the more frequently they're used. Hebbian learning continues to be an important model in AI.</h4>
        <h3>1950</h3>
        <h4>Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence, proposing what is now known as the Turing Test, a method for determining if a machine is intelligent. 
            Harvard undergraduates Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds build SNARC, the first neural network computer.
            Claude Shannon publishes the paper "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess."
            Isaac Asimov publishes the "Three Laws of Robotics."</h4>
            <h3>1952</h3>
            <h4>Arthur Samuel develops a self-learning program to play checkers. </h4>
            <h3>1954</h3>
            <h4>The Georgetown-IBM machine translation experiment automatically translates 60 carefully selected Russian sentences into English</h4>
            <h3>1956</h3>
            <h4>    The phrase artificial intelligence is coined at the "Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence." Led by John McCarthy, the conference, which defined the scope and goals of AI, is widely considered to be the birth of artificial intelligence as we know it today. 
                Allen Newell and Herbert Simon demonstrate Logic Theorist (LT), the first reasoning program. </h4>

        
            <h3>1958</h3>
            <h4>John McCarthy develops the AI programming language Lisp and publishes the paper "Programs with Common Sense." The paper proposed the hypothetical Advice Taker, a complete AI system with the ability to learn from experience as effectively as humans do.  </h4>

            <h3>1959</h3>
            <h4>    Allen Newell, Herbert Simon and J.C. Shaw develop the General Problem Solver (GPS), a program designed to imitate human problem-solving. 
                Herbert Gelernter develops the Geometry Theorem Prover program.
                Arthur Samuel coins the term machine learning while at IBM.
                John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky found the MIT Artificial Intelligence Project.</h4>
